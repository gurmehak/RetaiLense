## About RetaiLense

**RetaiLense** is an interactive dashboard designed to help a UK-based
online retail company monitor and optimize eCommerce sales across
international markets. It provides actionable insights into global
revenue, seasonal trends, top-selling products, and regional
performance. By analyzing product demand, return rates, and
country-specific data, users can identify growth opportunities, make
informed decisions, and fine-tune sales strategies for international
expansion.

## Motivation

### Problem:

Retail businesses often face challenges in quickly analyzing and
visualizing their sales data. Without clear insights, it becomes
difficult to spot trends, track top-performing products, and understand
revenue patterns across different countries and time periods.

### Solution:

RetaiLense offers an intuitive dashboard that makes it easy to explore
retail data through a variety of visualizations, enabling data-driven
decision-making. Key features include:

-   Bar charts highlighting top products by revenue
-   Line charts showing revenue trends over time
-   Stacked bar charts illustrating refunds and net revenue
-   Pie chart visualizing the geographic distribution of sales
-   Metric cards displaying key performance indicators (KPIs)

### How to use this app

The dashboard includes interactive filters to customize your view:

-   Date Range: Filter data by specific time periods
-   Country Selection: Focus on specific regions or compare countries
-   Dynamic Visualizations: All charts and metrics update automatically
    based on the selected filters
